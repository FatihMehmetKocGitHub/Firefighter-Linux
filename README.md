# Firefighter_Linux: An Open-Source Proactive Cyber Defense Doctrine

## Project Vision
Firefighter_Linux is a proactive, intelligence-driven, and predictive cybersecurity operations doctrine built entirely with open-source tools. It's designed to go beyond reactive defense, metaphorically not just extinguishing digital "fires" but proactively hunting for the "arsonists" and preventing fires from starting in the first place.

## Core Doctrine
The entire operation is built on three core principles:
* **Zero Trust:** No entity or traffic, internal or external, is trusted by default. Everything must be authenticated, authorized, and inspected.
* **Zero Tolerance:** No detected anomaly or policy violation is ignored. Every event requires either automated intervention or direct analyst response based on its severity.
* **Continuous Hunt:** We operate under the assumption of compromise. Instead of passively waiting for alarms, we are perpetually hunting for adversaries within our systems.

## Guiding Philosophy: GitOps as the Single Source of Truth
Every piece of configuration, setup, documentation, and code in the Firefighter_Linux infrastructure has a single official version: the one stored in a central Git repository. This principle brings auditability, versioning, and repeatability to the entire infrastructure.
* `Firefighter-Linux` (this repository): Contains the public doctrine, methodology, and documentation.
* `Firefighter_Linux-Infrastructure` (private repository): Contains the actual infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations.

## Technology Roadmap Overview

### V1: Building the Foundation - The Installation Manifesto
* **Phase 0: Core Infrastructure & Health:** Prometheus, Alertmanager, Apache Kafka, Vector, HashiCorp Vault, Docker.
* **Phase 1: Central Brain & Memory:** OpenSearch, MISP, OpenCTI.
* **Phase 2: Detection & Observation:** Wazuh, Falco, Suricata, Zeek, Arkime.
* **Phase 3: Active Intelligence & Hunt:** IntelOwl, T-Pot, CAPE Sandbox.
* **Phase 4: Command & Control:** TheHive, Cortex, osquery, FleetDM.
* **Phase 5: Doctrine & Knowledge Management:** MkDocs/BookStack, MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.

### V2: Automation - The Autonomous Defense Doctrine
* Full SOAR orchestration (Shuffle), Infrastructure as Code (Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes), and Detection-as-Code (CI/CD).

### V3: Evolution - Predictive Security & AI Dominance
* UEBA, Predictive Threat Modeling, NLP for automated intel gathering, and an AI-assisted decision support system.

---
This repository serves as the public-facing documentation and philosophy of the Firefighter_Linux project.
* **R&D Projects:** User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), Predictive Threat Modeling with AI on graph databases, NLP for automated intelligence gathering, and an AI-assisted decision support system for analysts.
